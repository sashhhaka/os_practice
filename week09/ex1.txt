1000p/100f, 1000p/500f
Random
Hit Ratio: 0.1050, 0.3590
NFU
Hit Ratio: 0.0990, 0.3570
Aging
Hit Ratio: 0.0980, 0.3540

Having more frames enhances the hit ratios because more pages
can be stored in memory, reducing page faults.
However, the choice of algorithm still influences the hit ratio,
with Random being more unpredictable compared to NFU and Aging.
On the given test cases and on my working machine NFU showed itself as a slightly better algorithm than Aging.
In general case the choice between the two depends on the specific characteristics
of the system and the desired adaptability to changing access patterns.
NFU might be more predictable, while Aging can adapt better to evolving usage patterns.
