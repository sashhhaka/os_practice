We create n named pipes for n subscribers because each subscriber needs its own communication channel (pipe) to receive messages.
Named pipes provide a way to establish a dedicated communication path between the publisher and each subscriber.
Without separate pipes, messages could get mixed up or lost when multiple subscribers try to read from the same pipe simultaneously.
