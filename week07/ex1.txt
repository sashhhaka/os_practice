Throughput of first_fit (queries per second): 125.64
Throughput of best_fit (queries per second): 46.09
Throughput of worst_fit (queries per second): 42.96
Explanation:
The First Fit algorithm exhibits the highest throughput, allocating memory by accepting the first available block
that fits the request. In contrast, the Best Fit and Worst Fit algorithms tend to allocate memory more slowly, because
they dedicate time to searching for the best or worst fitting blocks.
These differences are illustrating the speed-memory efficiency trade-offs in memory allocation algorithms.
