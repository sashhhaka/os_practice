The average turnaround time and average waiting time for the SJF algorithm is less than that of the FCFS algorithm.
This is because the SJF algorithm is non-preemptive and the processes are executed in the order of their burst times.
The process with the shortest burst time is executed first, followed by the next shortest burst time, and so on.
This results in a shorter average turnaround time and average waiting time.
